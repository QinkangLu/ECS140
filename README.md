# ECS140 - Programming Languages Principles
This repository include all the coding projects I did in this class from UC Davis, including the Skeleton Code and the Solution. If you want to learn about Programming Languages Principles and Design, I suggest you download the skeleton files and try to build the project with the detailed instructions given in the README.md files in each folder.
