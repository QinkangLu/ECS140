# Prolog

## Testing
To compile your prolog file, you first need to type gprolog in your terminal and then load the test file, facts.pl, and hw5.pl (they have to be in the same directory). Then you need to type the queries in the terminal run. If you want to run everything at the same time, you can use test.sh.

## Part 1: Simple Queries
You will be given sets of facts of the following form:
1. course(number, prereq, units)
Here number is an atom denoting the course number (for instance, ecs140a), prereq a list of course numbers, and units a number indicating the number of units associated with a course.

2. student(name, courses_taken)
Here name is an atom denoting a studentâ€™s name, and courses taken is a list of courses that the student has taken.

3. instructor(name, course_list)
Here name specifies the name of the instructor who teaches the set of courses in the list course list.

An example database of facts is shown below:

    course(ecs40, [ecs30], 4).
    course(ecs122a, [ecs100, ecs110], 3).
                .
                .
                .
    student(john, [ecs30, ecs40]).
                .
                .
                .
    instructor(jim, [ecs30, ecs110]).

Write the following separate queries:
(a) Find all courses with 3 or 4 credits (fc course).
(b) Find all courses whose immediate pre-requisite is ecs110 (prereq 110).
(c) Find names of all students in ecs140a (ecs140a students).
(d) Find the names of all instructors who teach johnâ€™s courses (instructor names).

## Part 2: List Manipulation Predicates
The goal of this part of the homework is to familiarize you with the notions of lists and predicate definitions in Prolog. This part requires you to define a number of simple predicates:

1. Write a predicate, all length, that takes a list and counts the number of atoms that occur in the list at
all levels.
```
?-all_length([a, b, c], X)
X = 3;
no
?-all_length([a, [b,c], [d,[e,f]]], Y)
Y = 6;
no
```
2. Define a predicate, equal a b(L), which returns true if L contains an equal number of a and b terms.

3. Define a predicate, swap prefix suffix(K,L,S), such that swap prefix suffix(K,L,S) is true if
    * K is a sub-list of L, and
    * S is the list obtained by appending the suffix of L following an occurrence of K in L, with K and with the prefix that precedes that same occurrence of K in L.
```
?-swap_prefix_suffix([c, d], [a, b, c, d, e], S).
yes. S=[e, c, d, a, b]
?-swap_prefix_suffix([c, e], [a, b, c, d, e], S).
no.
?-swap_prefix_suffix(K, [a, b, c, d, e], [b, c, d, e, a]).
yes. K=[a]
```
    Look at the class notes for the definitions of prefix, suffix, and sublist.
    
4. Define a predicate, palin(A) that is true if the list A is a palindrome, that is, it reads the same backwards as forwards. For instance, [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] is a palindrome, but [1, 2] is not.

5. A good sequence consists either of the single number 0, or of the number 1 followed by two other good sequences: thus, [1,0,1,0,0] is a good sequence, but [1,1,0,0] is not. Define a relation good(A) that is true if A is a good sequence.

## Part 3: Puzzle
Write a logic program to solve the following puzzle: A farmer must ferry a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage across a river using a boat that is too small to take more than one of the three across at once. If he leaves the wolf and the goat together, the wolf will eat the goat, and if he leaves the goat with the cabbage, the goat will eat the cabbage. How can he get all three across the river safely?
    Hints: Define the following predicates:

* Use terms, left and right, to denote the two banks.
* Define a term state(left,left,right,left) to denote the state in which the farmer, the wolf, and the cabbage are on the left bank, and the goat is alone on the right bank.
* Define a term, opposite(A,B), that is true if if A and B are different banks of the river.
* Define a term, unsafe(A), to indicate if state A is unsafe.
* Similarly define a term, safe(A).
* Define a term, take (X,A,B), for moving object X from bank A to bank B.
* Define a term, arc (N,X,Y), that is true if move N takes state X to state Y. Define the rule for the above terms. Now, the solution involves searching from a certain initial state to a final state. You may look at relevant examples in the textbook on how you can write your search algorithms.
