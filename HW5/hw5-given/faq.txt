* Can built-in predicates be used? 

Yes, you may use the built-in predicates. 

* Does the order of output matter? 

Order of output usually does not matter, as long as your results are
correct. But, as for previous homework assignments, do please match
the sample output exactly on the given tests to facilitate automated
grading.

* How to collect all possible solutions? 

The built-in predicates described at the following link: 
    http://www.gprolog.org/manual/html_node/gprolog033.html
can become handy. 

* How to format part 3 output? 

(1) Format your output exactly as follows (as a sequence of moves): 
take(wolf, left, right)
take(none, right, left)
...
 
Use 'none' when the farmer doesn't take anything across. 
 
(2) Name your top-level predicate as 'solve', i.e., 
solve :- ... 
 
So, when the following is queried: 
| ?- solve.
the sequence of moves will be given. 
 
(3) One shortest solution suffices (i.e., no useless moves).
